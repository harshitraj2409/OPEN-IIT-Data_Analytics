# Tourism Footfall Forecasting with Machine Learning

This repository contains the code and documentation for a project undertaken as part of Open IIT Data Analytics, conducted at IIT Kharagpur in November 2023.

## Overview

In this project, we aimed to forecast tourist footfall in Shimla, leveraging Google Trends data and machine learning techniques. The objective was to develop a robust model capable of predicting footfall trends accurately, even in the absence of direct tourist footfall data.

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing

- We collected data from Google Trends related to tourism in Shimla.
- Keywords related to tourism were manually classified and sorted into categorical bags.
- Spearman correlation analysis was performed to identify significant relationships between search keywords and tourist footfall.

### Feature Engineering and Model Development

- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was employed for feature reduction.
- Time series models such as ARIMA, SARIMA, and SARIMAX were implemented for footfall prediction.
- Model parameters were fine-tuned to achieve an accuracy of 92%, excluding the COVID-19 years.

### Solution Scaling

- The solution was scaled up for industrial purposes by automating the selection of relevant features.
- The PyTrend library in Python was utilized to predict footfall trends in cities where direct tourist footfall data is unavailable.
